```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Let's use the code provided below to generate a dataset representing two populations, each sampled from a Guassian with a specific population mean. Here I am generating only 5 samples

```{r}
set.seed(110)
data_1 = tibble(measure=rnorm(5, 10, 1))
data_1$site_name <- 'Site 1'
data_2 = tibble(measure=rnorm(5, 12, 1))
data_2$site_name <- 'Site 2'
complete_data = rbind(data_1, data_2)
complete_data
```

* I compute the mean of the dataset above using the following code:
  * feel free to deconstruct the code to see what each chunk does.

```{r}
mean(complete_data[complete_data$site_name == "Site 1", ]$measure)
mean(complete_data[complete_data$site_name == "Site 2", ]$measure)
```

* Use the `tapply` function instead of the code above to compute the means samples from "Site 1" and those from site 2
  * See tapply for help if needed.

```{r}
# Write your code here
tapply(complete_data$measure, complete_data$site_name, mean)
```

Q.2 

* Use the bootstrapping-procedure covered in class to assess whether there is a statistically significant difference between the data in `Site 1` and that in `Site 2`.

Make sure you follow the approach discussed in class and which consists of:

1. Selecting an appropriate test statistic
2. Bootstrapping a distribuion for the observed statistic under the null hypothesis
3. Desciding whether to accept or reject the null based on the probability of the null
4. provide a p-value to support your decision.

```{r}
set.seed(110)
data_1 = tibble(measure=rnorm(40, 10, 1))
data_1$site_name <- 'Site 1'
data_2 = tibble(measure=rnorm(40, 13, 1))
data_2$site_name <- 'Site 2'
complete_data = rbind(data_1, data_2)
```

#### Q2.0 

Complete the following by describing the null and the alternative hypotheses we are testing here.

The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the mean of site 1 and the mean of site 2. Any observed difference is merely due to sampling variance. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant difference between site 1 and 2, that is unlikely to have arisen due to chance alone

```{r}
t.test(data_1$measure, data_2$measure)
```

The p-value is 2.2e-16, which is very small and less than 0.05 so we reject our null hypothesis. There is indeed a significant difference between site 1 and 2.

#### Q.2.1 

Produce a graph similar the one below (geom_density) display the distributions. If you're using the same seed as mine, your graph will look exactly the same as the one below 

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rz5jxm84kk8ac1m/dist.png?dl=1)

```{r}
# write your code here

ggplot(data = complete_data, aes(x = measure, fill = site_name))+
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4, bw = 0.6)+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightpink", "cadetblue1"))+
  xlim(5, 18)+
  xlab("measure")+
  ylab("density")
  
```

Q2.2 Select a proper test statistic and produce a distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis. Plot the data as both a histogram and density curves. Your graph may look like this.

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3jarqg9swneai0r/mean_under_null.png?dl=1)

The test statistic is the difference in means. 

```{r}
set.seed(110)
data_1 = rnorm(40, 10, 1)
data_2 = rnorm(40, 13, 1)
mean(data_1) - mean(data_2)
```

```{r}
# concatenate two vector
a = c(1,2,3)
b = c(4,5,6)
c(a, b)
```

```{r}
# shuffle a vecor
sample(1:5)
```

```{r}
(split_pos + 1) : length(a)
```

```{r}
# split data

split_pos = 4

a = 1:10

a[1:split_pos]
a[(split_pos + 1) : length(a)]
```

```{r}
processOneIter = function(data_1, data_2){
    
    concat_data = c(data_1, data_2)
    len_concat_data = length(concat_data)
    
    len_data_1 = length(data_1)    
    shuffled_data = sample(concat_data)
    new_data_1 = shuffled_data[1:len_data_1]
    new_data_2 = shuffled_data[(len_data_1+1):len_concat_data]
    mean(new_data_1) - mean(new_data_2)
    
}
processOneIter(data_1, data_2)
    
```

```{r}
replicate(5, processOneIter(data_1, data_2))
```

```{r}
# histogram and density curve
mean_under_null = replicate(1000, processOneIter(data_1, data_2))

ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(mean_under_null, y=..density..), bins = 30, alpha = 0.2, color = "black") + 
  geom_density(aes(mean_under_null), bw = 0.2, size = 1.5) + 
  xlim(-2.5, 2.5)
```


####  Q2.3. 

Calculate and plot the observed statistic on the graph you created in Q.2.2. 

```{r}
# observed value
observed <- mean(data_1) - mean(data_2)
observed

# histogram with observed statistic
ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(mean_under_null, y=..density..), bins = 50, alpha=0.2, color = "black") + 
  geom_density(aes(mean_under_null), bw = 0.2, size = 1.5) + 
  xlim(-5, 5) + 
  geom_point(aes(observed, 0), color = "red", size = 10)
```

#### Q2.4 
Compute the p-value of the observed statistic under the null. What do you conclude about the hypotheses you enunciated in Q2.3

```{r}
# p value
sum(mean_under_null <= observed) / length(mean_under_null)

```

The p-value is 0 meaning that it is very unlikely we would observe this test statistic observation (-2.55) in a randomized scenario. The test statistic is very different from what the null hypothesis predicts. It is unlikely that there is no difference between the means of the two distributions.

#### Q.3 

* The proportion of the of _P. lobata_, _M. capitata_ and _P. mendrina_ at a site X are c(0.60, 0.19, 0.21).
* You surveyed site Y with different environmental conditions and obtains the following proportions for the three corals (0.61, 0.19, 0.20). Use the multinomial non-parametric hypotheses test to assess whether the proportions obtained at sites X and Y are statistically different.

Although not explicitly required, your test should cover all the steps in Q2, i.e. appropriate graph(s) when possible, test statistics, and conclusion.

## Hypotheses

*Null hypothesis:* There is no statistical difference in the proportions of P. lobata, M. capitata, and P. mendrina at site x and those at site y. Any observed differences in proportions is just due to sampling variance and chance.

*Alternative hypothesis:* The observed difference in proportions at the two sites is not merely chance because there is indeed a difference. 


## Coral proportions dataset and graphing

```{r}
# creating dataset and tibble of coral proportions at site x and site y
coral = c('P. lobata', 'P. lobata', 'M. capitata', 'M. capitata', 'P. mendrina', 'P. mendrina')
ratios = c(0.6, 0.61, 0.19, 0.19, 0.21, 0.20)
site = rep(c('site_x', 'site_y'), 3)

coral_proportions <- tibble(coral, ratios, site)
coral_proportions
```

```{r}
# plotting coral proportions at sites x and y
ggplot(coral_proportions, aes(x = coral, y = ratios, fill = site)) + 
    geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity") + 
    coord_flip()
```

## Total Variation Distance
We will use the Total Variation Distance as the test statistic.

```{r}
subtract <- function(x){
    x[1] - x[2]
}

subtract(c(20, 15))
```

```{r}
tapply(coral_proportions$ratios, coral_proportions$coral, subtract)
```

```{r}
subtract_abs <- function(x){
    abs(x[1] - x[2])
}

sum(tapply(coral_proportions$ratios, coral_proportions$site, subtract_abs))/2
```

```{r}
sample(c('_M. capitata_', '_P. mendrina_', '_P. mendrina_'), 200, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.60, 0.19, 0.21))

rmultinom(1, 200, prob=c(0.60, 0.19, 0.21))
rmultinom(1, 200, prob=c(0.60, 0.19, 0.21))/200
```


```{r}
sampleOneIteration = function(){
    true_proportions = c(0.60, 0.19, 0.21)
    sample_proportions = rmultinom(1, 200, prob=c(0.60, 0.19, 0.21))/200
    sample_tvd = sum(abs(true_proportions - sample_proportions))/2
    sample_tvd
        
}
sampleOneIteration()
```

```{r}
tvds <- replicate(1000, sampleOneIteration())
```

```{r}
observed_stat = sum(tapply(coral_proportions$ratios, coral_proportions$coral, subtract_abs))/2
observed_stat
```

```{r}
ggplot()+ 
  geom_histogram(aes(tvds, ..density..), bins = 15) +
  geom_point(aes(observed_stat, 0), size = 5, color="red")
```

```{r}
p_value = sum(tvds > observed_stat)  / length(tvds)
p_value
```

The p-value is 0.946 which is greater than 0.05. Therefore, there is no significant difference between the proportion of corals at site x and site y, and we accept our null hypothesis.
